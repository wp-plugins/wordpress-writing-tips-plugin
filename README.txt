== Intro ==

Welcome to the WordPress Writing Tips Plugin.

This particular plugin, by Meadows Interactive, displays professional writing tips, copywriting style and blogging advice at the top of the WordPress admin area.

It functions similar to the "Hello Dolly" plugin, which it's based on. The quick tips for this plugin were written by Brian Milne, who spent a decade in the newspaper business as a senior writer and editor before becoming a WP junkie.

== About ==

What’s the point of this plugin? To help everyday bloggers write more professionally, grammatically correct, improve on their style and blogging/SEO knowledge, and to make their work consistent with current web standards and copywriting guides used across the web.

For the most part, we follow The Yahoo! Style Guide, but there are a few instances where style is not included in the Yahoo! guide (WordPress, for example, is one word and both the W and P are uppercase!) and has been set according to brand guidelines or what official online organizations have determine to be the proper usage.


== Installation ==

Install by uploading this entire unzipped folder to your wp-content/plugins/ folder using your favorite FTP program. 

Or, you can also upload the zipped file of this plugin via the WordPress dashboard by clicking on Plugins - > Add New. From there, click "upload." That will allow you to browse your harddrive for the zipped folder and allow you to upload it. 

Once uploaded, you'll have to activate the plugin and refresh the dashboard. 

When activated, you'll notice the writing tips will start populating at the top of the admin pages.  For more information, see the "Hello Dolly" plugin by MA.TT, which this plugin is based on and owes all credit to. I just came up with the writing tips, which I'll continue to expand on once I know it's functioning properly.
